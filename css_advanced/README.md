# Summary
This task requires creating a `README.md` file for an HTML advanced project focusing on CSS and page styling. Design details are available on Figma, including a fig file for reference, and missing fonts can be accessed online. The README should be well-written, and the `index.html` file from the previous HTML advanced project needs to be copied over.

# Key Points
- The task involves creating a detailed `README.md` file for the project, focusing on CSS and page styling following the design details provided on Figma.
- Designers can access the fig file for additional design information and ensure that any missing fonts are downloaded. The README should be of high quality and include all necessary instructions for understanding and implementing the project.
